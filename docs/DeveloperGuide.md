### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.

3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should help users as they start the application for the first time with sample data.
5.  Interface should not hinder the users' usage of the application in order to input the data they need and get the desired response.
6.  The data files should be easily modifiable by a user with a basic understanding of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
