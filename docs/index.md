**DieTrack is a desktop application that allows users to easily track and maintain their meals so that they are able to maintain their ideal body weight.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* The product name is a play on the words "die", "diet" and "track". It is a syllogism that if the user does not track their diet, it could result in bad consequences that could ultimately result in death.

* If you are interested in using DieTrack, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in helping to develop DieTrack, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
